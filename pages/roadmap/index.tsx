                        Every year we hope to have a conference, a field trip,
                        a chance to meet local vitnesses and our annual meeting - in Hessdalen.
                        This time we are not ready at all, but we
                        would still like to meet other team-members
                        in the valley, not only on screen. And you are welcome too. <br />
                        Next year we will be better prepared - but then there may be a price tag!
                        Because we want to make it interesting, educational and fun.

                        &quot;We recognize that the cost of our Sky360 citizen science project
                        must be as low as possible. Therefore, we recommend a modular system.
                        Start with basic equipment and add more sensors later.
                        Currently the range is US$ 1,500 - 5,000.&quot;

                        So we need more than 50.000 NOK to get started.<br />
                        We would prefer 100.000 NOK, so we can buy two cameras.<br />

                        But this is not the only equipment we need.
                        And we need more than equipment - we need people to set up the equipment
                        and configure everything - make sure it sends data to our database.
                        We need people to analyze the data. We need a lot!
                        And we need money to pay for all this. And all the money we get,
                        we will spend on equipment and software solutions.
